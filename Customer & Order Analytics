#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?     
SELECT COUNT(ORDERID) FROM BIT_DB.JANSALES
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(ORDERID) FROM BIT_DB.jansales
    WHERE product = 'iPhone'
    AND length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum
    FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
    JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales febsales
    ON customers.order_id = febsales.orderID
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
    
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?  
SELECT Product, MIN(price) AS LowestPrice
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan;
#OR    
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price) AS revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
    ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
    WHERE feb.Quantity > 2
    AND length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
    GROUP BY product;
